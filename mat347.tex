\section{Groups}
Groups are generally associated with symmetries. Consider the equilateral triangle:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        % draw a triangle and label the vertices A, B, C
        \draw (0,0) -- (4,0) -- (2,3.464) -- cycle;
        \node[above] at (2,3.464) {$A$};
        \node[below] at (4,0) {$B$};
        \node[below] at (0,0) {$C$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
We know that there are six symmetries of the triangle:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identity transformation (do nothing) denoted as $\id$ or $e$
    \item Two rotations ($A\to B\to C\to A$ and $A\to C\to B\to A$)
    \item Three reflections % A <-> B
    $A \leftrightarrow B$, $A \leftrightarrow C$, $B \leftrightarrow C$
\end{itemize}
Note that these symmetries preserve the structure of the triangle, hence the composition of two symmetries must also be a symmetry. Let
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\rho$ be the rotation $A\to B\to C\to A$
    \item $\sigma$ be the reflections $B\leftrightarrow C$
\end{itemize}
Note that $\rho\sigma$ is the $A\leftrightarrow C$ reflection and $\sigma\rho$ is the $A\leftrightarrow B$ reflection. Hence they may not be commutative.

% Note that a square has eight symmetries. Then, that tells us that the square and triangle are two different shapes (this applies in general).

We also know that all symmetries can be reversed. $\alpha$ has an inverse $\alpha\inv$ such that $\alpha\alpha\inv = \alpha\inv\alpha = e$. These inspires the following definition:

\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{group} is a set $G$ with a composition
    \begin{align}
        G\times G &\to G \\
        (g, h) &\mapsto g\cdot h
    \end{align}
    Satisfying:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Associativity: $(g\cdot h)\cdot k = g\cdot (h\cdot k)$
        \item Identity: $\exists\, e\in G$ such that $g\cdot e = e\cdot g = g$ for all $g\in G$
        \item Inverse: $\forall\, g\in G$, $\exists\, g\inv\in G$ such that $g\cdot g\inv = g\inv\cdot g = e$
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Z$ with $+$ is a group. It is associative, $e = 0$ and $g\inv = -g$.
    \item $\Z/n\Z$ with addition modulo $n$.
    \item If $F$ is a field, it implicitly has two group structures:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Additive group: $(F,+)$ is a group. It is associative, $e = 0$ and $g\inv = -g$.
        \item Multiplicative group: $(F\setminus\{0\},\times)$ is a group. It is associative, $e = 1$ and $g\inv = 1/g$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item $GL(n,F)$ -- ``general linear group'' contains all invertiable $n\times n$ matrices.
    \item $SL(n,F)$ -- ``special linear group'' contains all invertiable $n\times n$ matrices with determinant $1$.
    \item $SO(n,F)$ -- ``special orthogonal group'' $=\{A\in SL(n,F)|A^t=A\inv\}$.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Cyclic Groups}
One of the simplest groups is $\Z/n\Z$ for $n\in\N$ with the operation addition modulo n. This is known as the ``cyclic group of order $n$'' or $C_n$. i.e. for $n=8$, $5+7=4\,(\mathrm{mod}\,8)$, which we denote $\bar{5}+\bar{7}=\bar{4}$.

We know the inverse $\bar k\inv=\overline{n-k}$ for nonzero $k$ or $\bar 0\inv=\bar 0.$

Another way to express the cyclic group is $\bar k\leftrightarrow e^{2\pi i k/n}$ with multiplication operation. Then, \begin{align}
    \overline{k+n}=e^{2\pi i (k+n)/n}=e^{2\pi i k/n}e^{2\pi i n/n}=e^{2\pi i k/n}=\bar k.
\end{align}

% draw a circle and 8 equally spaced points on it
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw (0,0) circle (2cm);
        \foreach \x in {0,1,...,7}
        {
            % draw dot
            \draw (\x*45:2cm) circle (1pt);
        }
        % label the first point
        \node[below] at (0*45:2cm) {$1\leftrightarrow\bar 0$};
        % draw xy axis
        \draw (-3cm,0) -- (3cm,0);
        \draw (0,-3cm) -- (0,3cm);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{definition}[Order]
    The \textbf{order} of a group $G$ is its cardinality denoted $\mathrm{ord}(G)$ or $|G|$. It could be a finite or infinite ordinal. In particular, $|C_n| = n$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Quaternion Group}
The quaternion group $\mathbb{H}=\{\pm1,\pm i,\pm j,\pm k\}$ is a group of order $8$ with the multiplication operation. It has 

\begin{definition}[Subgroup]
    A \textbf{subgroup} of a group $G$ is a subset $H\subseteq G$ such that $H$ is a group. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Coset]
    If $G$ is a group and $H\leq G$, consider sets of the form
    \begin{equation}
        Hg=\{hg|h\in H\}
    \end{equation}
    This is a \textbf{right coset} of $H$.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Partitioning with Cosets]
    Consider $Hg$ and $Hg'$ for $g.g'\in G$. There are two cases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They might be disjoint: $Hg\cap Hg'=\emptyset$.
        \item They might intersect. Suppose $hg=h'g'$ for some $h,h'\in H$
        \begin{align}
            h\inv hg&=h\inv h'g'\\
            g&=h\inv h'g'\in Hg'
        \end{align}
        Similarly, $g'\in Hg$. Consider an arbitrary element of $kg\in Hg$ with $k\in H$. Then, $kg=kh\inv h'g'\in Hg'$ i.e. $Hg\leq Hg'$. Similarly, $Hg'\leq Hg$. Thus, $Hg=Hg'$.
    \end{itemize}
    The right cosets of $H$ partition $G$. In particular,
    \begin{equation}
        G = \bigsqcup Hg_i
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

For fixed $g$, if $hg=h'g$ for $h,h'\in H$ then $hgg\inv=h'gg\inv$ so $h=h'$. So in $Hg$, every element can be matched with an element of $H$. So, $|Hg|=|H|$.

\begin{theorem}[Lagrange]
    If $|G|<\infty$ and $H\leq G$, then $|H|\Big\vert|G|$
\end{theorem}
\begin{definition}[Index]
    For $H\leq G$, the \textbf{index} of $H$ in $G$ is $[G:H]=|G|/|H|$.
\end{definition}
If $|G|=13$, the only subgroups or $G$ are $\{e\},G$.

If $G=\Z$ and $H=2\Z$ (even numbers). Then $H+0=H$ is one coset, and $H+1=$ the odd integers is another coset. So, $\Z=(2\Z)\sqcup(2\Z+1)$.

\underline{Same for Left Cosets}
Interaction of left and right cosets? 

Consider the triangle group with rotations $e,\rho,\rho^2$ and reflections $\sigma_A, \sigma_B, \sigma_C$ Consider the subgroup $H=\{e,\sigma_A\}$.
\begin{align}
    He&=\{e,\sigma_A\}\\
    H\rho&=\{\rho,\sigma_B\}\\
    H\rho^2&=\{\rho^2,\sigma_C\}\\
    eH=\{e,\sigma_A\}\\
    \rho H&=\{\rho, \sigma_C\}\\
    \rho^2 H&=\{\rho^2,\sigma_B\}
\end{align}
Note that the left and right cosets are different. They are the same if the group is commutative.

\begin{definition}[Action]
    An \textbf{action} of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is a map \begin{align}
        G&\times X\to X \\
        (g,x)&\mapsto gx
    \end{align}
    such that 
    \begin{align}
        (gh)x&=g(hx)\\
        ex&=x
    \end{align}
\end{definition}

If $G$ is a group, it acts on itself. This is called a ``left translation'' or ``left regular action''.

How about the right action $(g,x)\mapsto xg$. The second condition may not be true\begin{align}
    (gh,x)=xgh\\
    (g,(hx))=(g,xh)=xhg
\end{align} which is not true. Instead, let $(g,x)=xg\inv$. Then,
\begin{align}
    (gh,x)=x(gh)\inv=xh\inv g\inv\\
    (g,(h,x))=(g,xh\inv)=xh\inv g\inv
\end{align}
This is the definition of the right action.

There is a third action of $G$ on itself by $(g,x)=gxg\inv.$ This action is called conjugation.

Take the following example: Let $G=SO(3)$ and let $X=S^2$. $G$ acts on $X$ by rotation. Let $H=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}
    \cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0\\
    \sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}\right\}$ be the subgroup of rotations that fixes the $z$-axis. 

$H$ also acts on $X$ ??
\begin{definition}[Orbit]
    If $G$ acts on $X$, the \textbf{orbit} of $x\in X$ is the set $Gx=\{gx|g\in G\}$. i.e. the set of all points $x$ is taken to by elements of $G$.
\end{definition}

The orbits of $H\approx SO(2)$ on the sphere are the lines of latitude (and the north and south poles). 

$H$ fixes the north pole, thus every coset $gH$ takes the north pole to a point. Suppose $gH$ and $g'H$ are cosets such that $gHN=g'HN\implies gN=g'N\implies (g')\inv gN=N\implies (g')\inv g\in H\implies gH...$ so the points ofn the sphere are in 1-1 correspondence with the left cosets of $H$. 
\begin{definition}[Stabilizer]
    If $G$ acts on $X$ and $x\in X$, the ``stabilizer'' of $x$ in $G$ is $\{g\in G|gx=x\}$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Centralizer]
    If $A\subset G$, the \textbf{centralizer} of $A$ in $G$ is $C_G(A)=\{g\in G|ga= ag\forall a\in A\}$
\end{definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $G$ is abelian, then $C_G(A)=G$ for any $A$. 
    \item In the triangle group, $C_G(\{\rho\})=\{e,\rho,\rho^2\}$
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}[Center]
    The \textbf{center} of $G$ is $Z(G)=\{g\in G|gg'=g'g\forall g'\in G\}=C_G(G)$ 
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
    For any $A\subset G$, $C_G(A)\leq Z(G)$ (is a subgroup).
\end{proposition}

Consider the regular $n$-gon ($n\geq3$), what are its rigid motion symmetries?
\begin{itemize}
    \item There are always $n$ rotations by $\frac{2\pi}{n}$ about the origin.
    \item When $n$ is even, there are $n/2$ reflections in each pair of edges, and each pair of vertices. When $n$ is odd, there are $n$ reflections in each pair of (edge, vertex). There are always $n$ reflections.
    \item Write $\rho$ for clockwise rotation by $\frac{2\pi}{n}$. Fix one vertex and let $\sigma$ be the reflection that fixes that vertex.
    \item Note that $\rho\sigma=\sigma\rho\inv$. To show this, it suffices to find where two of the vertices gets mapped.
\end{itemize}
\begin{proposition}
    The symmetries are $e,\rho,\rho^2,\dots,\rho^{n-1},\sigma,\sigma\rho,\sigma\rho^2,\dots,\sigma\rho^{n-1}$
\end{proposition}
\begin{definition}[dihedral group]
    The group of symmetries of the regular $n$-gon is $D_{2n}$, the \textbf{dihedral group} of order $2n$.
\end{definition}

Given $H\leq G$ we write $G/H$ as the set of left cosets
\begin{align}
    G/H&=\{gH|g\in G\}\\
    H\setminus G&=\{Hg|g\in G\}
\end{align}
Both of these are called ``$G$ mod $H$''. In general, the two are \underline{different}. 

Now we want to ask, is $H\setminus G$ a group?
\begin{itemize}
    \item The most naive idea is to reuse multiplication in $G$, i.e. $Hg\cdot Hg'=Hgg'$, but it only sometimes works.
    \item This formula means: $hg\cdot h'g'=h''gg'$. For any $h,h'\in H,\exists h''$ s.t. this holds.
    \item Trick: $hg\cdot h'g'=hgh'eg'=hgh'(g\inv g)g'=h(ghg\inv)gg'$. Now we can ask if $ghg\inv\in H$ (for every $h'\in H$)
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}[Normal Subgroup]
    A subgroup $H\leq G$ is \textbf{normal} if $ghg\inv\in H\forall g\in G,h\in H$, which is abbreviated as $gHg\inv=H$. $H\trianglelefteq G$ means $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$
\end{definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Notice that if $gHg\inv=H$ then $gH=Hg$. So $H$ is normal, the left and right cosets must be the same.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[Quotient Group]
    If $H\trianglelefteq G$, then $G/H$ is called the quotient group.
\end{definition}
\subsection{Homomorphisms}
\begin{definition}[Homomorphism]
    If $G,K$ are groups, a \textbf{homomorphism} is a map $\varphi:G\to K$ such that $\varphi(gg')=\varphi(g)\varphi(g')\,\forall g,g'\in G$.
\end{definition}
Observations: IF $\varphi:G\to K$ is a homomorphism and $g\in G$, then
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\varphi(g)=\varphi(eg)=\varphi(e)\varphi(g)$, so $\varphi(e)=e$ (the identity element of $K$)
    \item $e=\varphi(e)=\varphi(gg\inv)=\varphi(g)\varphi(g\inv)$, so $\varphi(g\inv)=\varphi(g)\inv$
\end{enumerate}
Examples
\begin{itemize}
    \item $G=\Z$ and $\varphi:\Z\to\Z, \varphi(n)=2n$ is a homomorphism, as $\varphi(n+m)=2(n+m)=2n+2m=\varphi(n)+\varphi(m)$
    \item $G=\Z,K=\R$ and $\varphi:\Z\to\R,\varphi(n)=n$. This mapping is called an \bluebf{inclusion} as $Z\subset\R$.
    \item If $G$ is a group and $g_0\in G$, then $C_{g_0}:G\to G,g\mapsto g_0gg_0\inv$ is a homomorphism.
    \item A linear transformation $T:V\to W$ if $V,W$ are vector spaces (the additive group). 
    \item Note that $\varphi:g\mapsto g\inv$ is \bluebf{only} a homomorphism if $G$ is abelian.
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}[Kernel/Image]
    If $\varphi:G\to G'$ is a homomorphism, then the \textbf{kernel} of $\varphi$ is\begin{equation}
        \ker(\varphi)=\{g\in G|\varphi(g)=e\}.
    \end{equation}
    The \textbf{image} of $\varphi$ is\begin{equation}
        \mathrm{im}(\varphi)=\{\varphi(g)|g\in G\}\subseteq G'
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
    $\ker(\varphi)\leq G$ and $\mathrm{im}(\varphi)\leq G'$ $\ker(\varphi)\trianglelefteq G$
    \begin{proof}
        Since $\varphi(e)=e$, $e\in\ker(\varphi)$, and $e\in\mathrm{im}(\varphi)$.
        So both are nonempty.

        Suppose $g,h\in\ker(\varphi)$, $e=\varphi(e)=\varphi(hh\inv)=\varphi(h)\varphi(h\inv)$ \dots
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Suppose $N\trianglelefteq G$ and then define $G\to G/N, g\mapsto Ng$. We claim this is a homomorphism. Proof is simple $\varphi(gg')=Ngg'$, $\varphi(g)\varphi(g')=NgNg'=NgN(g\inv gg')=N(gNg\inv)gg'=NNgg'=Ngg'$ 
    \item This map is called the (natural) \bluebf{projection} of $G$ onto $G/N$. Sometimes written $\Pi_{G/N}$ or $\mathrm{proj}_{G/N}$.
    \item $\mathrm{im}(\Pi_{G/N})=G/N$ and $\ker(\Pi_{G/N})=N$.
    \item Any homomorphism is related to this one, so this could be considered as the ``generic homomorphism''.
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}[Isomorphism]
    If $\varphi:G\to H$ is a homomorphism, and $\ker(\varphi)=\{e\}$ then $\varphi$ is injective.
    If $\varphi(G)=H$ then $\varphi$ is surjective. Thinking of $G$ and $H$ as sets, there is an inverse $\varphi\inv:H\to G$ such that $\varphi\inv\circ\varphi=1_G$ and $\varphi\circ\varphi\inv=1_H.$ It is easy to check that $\varphi\inv$ is also a homomorphism.

    In this case, $\varphi$ is an \textbf{isomorphism}
\end{definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Suppose we have an injective homomorphism $\varphi:G\to H$ where $\ker(\varphi)=\{e\}.$ Then, we can consider $\varphi:G\to\mathrm{im}(\varphi)<H.$ Sometimes we say $\varphi:G\to H$ is an \bluebf{isomorphism into} $H,$ as opposed to an isomorphism \bluebf{onto} $H$ or between $G$ and $H.$
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}[Automorphism]
    If $G$ is a group, an \textbf{automorphism} of $G$ is an isomorphism $\varphi:G\to G.$
\end{definition}
Examples:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $G=\Z,n\mapsto-n$ is the only automorphism apart from the identity.
    \item If $G$ is abelian, $g\mapsto g\inv$ is an automorphism.
    \item If $F$ is a field, and $G=GL(n,F)$ then $g\mapsto(g^t)\inv$ (transposed inverse) is an automorphism.
    \item If we fix $g_0\in G$ then the conjugation $C_{g_0}:G\to G$ where $C_{g_0}(g)=g_0g{g_0}\inv$ is an automorphism. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}[Automorphism Group]
    $\mathrm{Alt}(G)$ is the \textbf{group} of automorphisms of $G$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Inner/Outer Automorphisms]
    The \textbf{inner automorphisms} of $G$ are \begin{equation}
        \textrm{Inn}(G)=\{\varphi\in\mathrm{Alt}(G)|\varphi=C_{g_0}\text{ for some }g_0\in G\}.
    \end{equation}
    If an element of $\mathrm{Alt}(G)$ that is not inner is \textbf{outer}.
\end{definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is easy to show that $\mathrm{Inn}(G)\leq\mathrm{Alt}(G).$ 
    \item Observe that if $G$ is abelian, then $\mathrm{Inn}(G)=\{\mathrm{id}\}$
    \item In general, $\{\mathrm{id}\}\leq\mathrm{Inn}(G)\leq\mathrm{Alt}(G).$
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The map \begin{align}
        G&\to\mathrm{Alt}(G)\\
        g&\to C_g
    \end{align}
    is a homomorphism. Its image is $\mathrm{Inn}(G)$ and its kernel is $Z_G$ (the center).
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}[Fiber]
    If $p$ is a projection, then $p\inv(x)$ is the \textbf{fiber} over $x$
\end{definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $N\triangleleft G,$ the projection $\pi:G\to G/N$ is a homomorphism. The fibers of $\pi$ is the cosets $gN=Ng,$ and they are all the same size.
    \item Suppose $\varphi:G\to H$ is a homomorphism, and $N=\ker(\varphi)\trianglelefteq G.$ The fibers of $\varphi$ is the cosets of $G/N.$
    \item We have $\varphi:G\to H$ and $\pi:G\to G/N.$ Wouldn't it be nice if $G/N\to H$ ``induced by $\varphi$'' were a homomorphism? Well, it is. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{theorem}[(First) Isomorphism]
    If $\varphi:G\to H$ is a homomorphism, and $N=\ker(\varphi),$ then there is a homomorphism $\bar\varphi:G/N\to H$ such that $\bar\varphi\circ\pi=\varphi.$ 
    
    Moreover, $\ker(\bar\varphi)=\{eN\},$ the trivial subgroup of $G/N,$ so $\bar\varphi$ is injective. So, $\bar\varphi:G/N\to\mathrm{im}(\varphi)$ is an \bluebf{isomorphism}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This theorem suggests that you can construct an isomorphism from an arbitrary homomorphism. First, $\varphi$ factors through $G/N,$ then we can include it into $H.$
    \begin{equation}
        G\to^\pi G/N\to^{\bar\varphi}\mathrm{im}(\varphi)\to^{\text{inclusion}}H
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}[(Third) Isomorphism]
    $N\trianglelefteq G$ and $H\leq G,$ then $N\leq H\implies N\trianglelefteq G.$
    \begin{proof}
        ????
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
    \begin{equation}
        G/H\cong G/N\Big/H/N
    \end{equation}
    \begin{proof}
        Define $\varphi:G\to G/N\Big/H/N$ by \begin{align}
            \varphi(g)=(gN)H/N
        \end{align}
        We need to show $\varphi$ is a homomorphism. Let \begin{align}
            \varphi(gg')&=gg'N\:H/N\\
            &=gNg'N\:H/N\\
            &=gN\:H/N\cdot g'N\:H/N\\
            &=\varphi(g)\varphi(g')\\
        \end{align}
    \end{proof}
    We will then ask what is $\ker(\varphi).$ Suppose $\varphi(g)=H/N,$ so $gN\:H/N=H/N.$ But $g$ is a representation for $gN,$ so $gH/N$ for this to be in $H/N$ we want $g\in H$ so $\ker(\varphi)=H.$ An arbitrary element of $G/N\Big/H/N$ is $gN\:H/N$ for some $g\in G,$ so $\mathrm{im}(\varphi)=G/N\Big/H/N.$
\end{theorem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $G=\Z,H=3\Z,K=4\Z.$ By the second isomorphism theorem, $\Z/3\Z\cong 4\Z/12\Z,$ and also $Z/4\Z\cong 3\Z/12\Z.$
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}[Equivilence Class]
    Being in the same coset of a subgroup $H$ is an equivalence relation. So, the large group is a disjoint union of equivalence classes (cosets) of $H.$
\end{definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The cosets of $\Z$ in $\R$ is $r+\Z$ for $r\in[0,1).$
    \item Homomorphism $\varphi:\R\to\C^\times, t\mapsto e^{2\pi it}.$ Then, $\ker(\varphi)=\Z.$ Observe tat $\varphi$ is \bluebf{onto} the unit circle, by the first isomorphism theorem, $\R/\ker(\varphi)=\R/\Z\cong S^1.$
    \item $\Z^2\triangleleft\R^2$
\end{itemize}
\begin{theorem}[Fourth Isomorphism Theorem/Lattice Theorem]
    Consider a lattice of subgroups with $N\trianglelefteq G.$ In $G/N,$ the subgroup lattice has the same structure as the subgroup lattice of $G$ that contains $N.$

    Specifically, if $N\trianglelefteq G,$ and $N\trianglelefteq H<G,$ we write $\bar H=H/N.$ Including $\bar G=G/N$ and $\bar N=\bar e=N/N.$

    Then, the lattice of $\bar H$s in $\bar G$ has the same lattice structures as the part of the lattice for $G$ consisting of subgroups that are intermediate between $N$ and $G.$ Moreover,\begin{align}
        H\leq K&\iff\bar H\leq\bar K\\
        H\trianglelefteq K&\iff\bar H\trianglelefteq\bar K\\
        [H:K]&=[\bar H:\bar K] \text{ if }K\leq H\\
        \overline{H\cap K}&=\bar H\cap\bar K\\
        \overline{\langle H,K\rangle}&=\langle\bar H,\bar K\rangle
    \end{align}
\end{theorem}
If $G,G'$ are groups, consider the cartesian product $G\times G'=\{(g,g')|g\in G,g'\in G'\}.$ Note that $|G\times G'|=|G||H|.$ There is an obvious way to turn this into a group by\begin{align}
    (g,g')(h,h')&=(gh,g'h')\\
    (g,g')^{-1}&=(g^{-1},g'^{-1})
    e=(e,e)
\end{align}
In $G\times G',$ the subset $G_0=:\{(g,e)|g\in G\}\cong G$ is a subgroup. Likewise, $G'_0=:\{(e,g')|g'\in G'\}\cong G'.$ Also notice that $G_0$ and $G'_0$ commute. So, $(G\times G')/G_0\cong G'.$

\subsection{Symmetric Groups}
\begin{definition}[Symmetric Group]
    The symmetric group $S_n$ is the group of permutation of $n$ elements, with composition as the operation.
\end{definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $|S_n|=n!$
    \item A cycle is a permutation that cycles through some subset of $\{1,\dots,n\}$, denoted as \begin{align}
        (a_1\,a_2\,\dots\,a_k),\quad k\leq n\text{ and }a_i\text{ are distinct.}
    \end{align}
    Represents the permutation $a_1\to a_2\to\dots\to a_k\to a_1.$
    \item Note that these are ambiguous, as $(a_1\,a_2\,\dots\,a_k)$ is the same as $(a_2\,a_3\,\dots\,a_k\,a_1).$ So by convention, we often start with the smallest number first so they are unique. 
    \item $k$ is the length of the cycle, it is also called a \bluebf{$k$-cycle}.
    \item Every permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles. If given a permutation, we will start from $1$ and write a cycle until we get back to $1.$ Then, we will start from the next number that hasn't been included yet and repeat until we get to the end.
    \item If $\sigma=(1\,3\,6)(4\,5),$ then $\sigma\inv=(4\,5)\inv(1\,3\,6)\inv=(4\,5)(1\,6\,3)=(1\,6\,3)(4\,5).$ We will order the cycles by their first element, and omit $1$-cycles.
    \item Two \bluebf{disjoint cycles} (i.e. without any numbers in common) will commute.
    \item If cycles are not disjoint, like $\sigma=(1\,4\,2)(2\,3\,5)(3\,4\,7)\in S_7$ will not commute.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $1\to4$
        \item $4\to7$
        \item $7\to3\to5$
        \item $5\to2\to1$
        \item $2\to3$
        \item $3\to4\to2$
    \end{itemize}
    So $\sigma=(1\,4\,7\,5)(2\,3).$
    \item Any $k$-cycle is a product of $2$-cycles. Thus, every element in the symmetric group can be written as a product of $2$-cycles so $S_n$ is generated by $2$-cycles. For example, if $k=4$ and $\sigma=(a\,b\,c\,d),$ then $\sigma=(a\,d)(a\,c)(a\,b).$
    \item We can ask what is the minimum number of $2$-cycles needed to generate any $\sigma\in S_n.$ In general, this is a very difficult question to answer. However, the \bluebf{parity} of the number of $2$-cycles in a product equalling $\sigma$ is well-defined.
    \item If $\sigma=(a_1\,b_1)(a_2\,b_2)\dots(a_k\,b_k)$ is a product of $2$-cycles, then $\sigma$ is \bluebf{even} if $k$ is even, and \bluebf{odd} if $k$ is odd.
    \item \redbf{Warning: a $k$-cycle is even if $k$ is odd, and odd if $k$ is even.}
    \item To make odd and even well defined, we need to know that the parity of a permutation is independent of the way we write the cycles.
    \begin{proof}
        Given $\sigma\in S_n$ is a $k$-cycle. Define $\Delta=\prod_{1\leq i<j\leq n}(j-i).$ If $\tau\in S_n$, it acts on $\Delta$ with \begin{align}
            \tau\cdot\Delta=\prod_{1\leq i<j\leq n}(\tau(j)-\tau(i)).
        \end{align}
        These two products are the same up to a factor of $\pm1,$ you have to multiply by $-1$ for each pair $i<j$ for which $\tau(i)>\tau(j).$
        
        We will consider how $(a\,b)$ with $a<b$ affect $\Delta.$ If neither $i$ nor $j$ is equal to $a$ or $b,$ the term is unaffected. Note that \begin{itemize}
            \item If $i<a,$ then $i<\tau(a)=b$ and $i<\tau(b)=a.$ So $(i\,a)$ or $(i\,b)$ are unaffected.
            \item Likewise, for $j>b$ then $(a\,j)$ or $(b\,j)$ are unaffected.
        \end{itemize}
        The only pairs that will be affected are ones $(a\,i),(i\,b)$ with $a<i<b$ and $(a\,b).$ If $a<i<b,$ then both $(a\,i)$ and $(i\,b)$ will change sign, so the product will be unaffected. $(a\,b)$ will change sign, so $\Delta$ will change sign under a transposition.

        If $\sigma\in S_n,$ write it as any product of $k$ transpositions. If $\sigma\cdot\Delta=\Delta$ then there must be an even number of transpositions. If $\sigma\cdot\Delta=-\Delta$ then there must be an odd number of transpositions. Thus, the parity of $\sigma$ is independent of the way we write it.
    \end{proof}
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}[Sign]
    The sign of $\sigma\in S_n$ is \begin{equation}
        \sgn(\sigma)=(-1)^k,
    \end{equation}
    if $\sigma$ is a product of $k$ transpositions. 
\end{definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Note that $\sgn(\sigma\tau)=(-1)^k(-1)^l=(-1)^{k+l}=\sgn(\sigma)\sgn(\tau).$
    \item Thus, $\sgn:S_n\to\{\pm1\}$ is a homomorphism.
    \item $\ker(\sgn)=A_n\trianglelefteq S_n$ is the alternating group of $k$ elements which contains all the even permutations. Note that
    \begin{align}
        S_n/A_n\cong\{\pm1\}\quad[S_n:A_n]=2\quad|A_n|=\frac{n!}{2}
    \end{align}
    \item for $n>5,$ $A_n$ has no normal subgroups. What are the possible cycle types in $A_5$? There is $(a\,b\,c\,d\,e),(a\,b)(c\,d),(a\,b\,c)$
    \item Let $\sigma\in S_n$ with $a\to b\to c\to\cdots,$ and suppose $\tau\in S_n$ takes $a\to a',b\to b',c\to c',\dots.$ Consider the conjugation $\tau\sigma\tau\inv.$\begin{align}
        \tau\sigma\tau\inv(a')=\tau\sigma(a)=\tau(b)=b'\\
        \tau\sigma\tau\inv(b')=\tau\sigma(b)=\tau(c)=c'\\
    \end{align}
    So $\tau\sigma\tau\inv$ takes $a'\to b'\to c'\to\cdots.$ Conjugating by $\tau$ ``relabels'' what $\sigma$ by replacing $a$ with $a',$ \dots.
\end{itemize}
