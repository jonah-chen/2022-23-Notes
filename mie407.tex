\textbf{Nuclear Stability:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stability of nucleus is the result of the balance between the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force.
    \item Range of the strong nuclear force is about \SI{1}{fm} (femtometre, \SI{e-13}{cm})
    \item The strong nuclear force acts equally between protons and neutrons, but neutrons also reduce repulsions between protons by pushing them further apart from each other.
    \item Fermi approx: $r = R_0 A^{1/3}$ where $R_0 = \SI{1.2}{fm}$
    \item The strong nuclear force is repulsive at very small distances, which contributes to the incompressibility of the nucleus.
    \item The strong nuclear force is insignificant at larger than around 4 proton diameters.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Nuclear Binding Energy:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The binding energy of a nucleus can be found by calculating the mass defect of the nucleus compared to the mass of the unbound nucleons.
    \begin{equation}
        E_B=[Zm_p + (A-Z)m_n - m] c^2\equiv \Delta M\times c^2
    \end{equation}
    \item The binding energy is usually expressed as the average binding energy per nucleon $\varepsilon = E_B/A$.
    \item \SI{1}{u}$=$\SI{931.5}{MeV/c^2}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Compound nucleus decay modes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Neutron capture $(n,\gamma)$: Nucleus decays to a lower energy state by emitting some gamma rays. $n+ ^AX\to ^{A+1}X^*\to ^{A+1}X+\gamma$
    \item Elastic scattering $(n,n')$: Neutron is re-emitted after leaving the nucleus in the ground state.
    \item Inelastic scattering $(n,n'\gamma)$: Neutron (usually high energy) is re-emitted at a lower energy, leaving the nucleus in an excited state. Then, the nucleus emits some gamma rays to return to the ground state.
    \item Fission $(n,f)$: Nucleus splits into two fragments with approx. $2:3$ mass ratio.
    \item Particle emission $(n,\alpha),(n,p),(n,kn)$: A particle other than a neutron, or multiple neutrons are emitted. Only occurs with very high energy neutrons. Hence, only a small number of $(n,2n)$ reactions occur in nuclear reactors.
\end{itemize}
